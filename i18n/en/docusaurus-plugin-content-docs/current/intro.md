# Introduction

Welcome to my website.

I'm Zephyr, an AI engineer from Taiwan and the founder of this organization.

## What's Here

- For paper reviews, see next door: [**Papers**](https://docsaid.org/papers/intro).
- For the blog section, it's the door after next: [**Blog**](https://docsaid.org/blog).

Ôºä

I have completed several projects on Github, including:

1. [**AutoTraderX**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/AutoTraderX)ÔºöThis project is used for automatic trading, mainly for Taiwan stock trading.
2. [**DocsaidKit**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocsaidKit): This is a toolbox of small utilities I use regularly.
3. [**DocAligner**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocAligner): This project provides text localization functionality, mainly used to pinpoint the four corners of a document.
4. [**DocClassifier**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/DocClassifier): This project is used for calculating text similarity, inspired by facial recognition systems.
5. [**GmailSummary**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/GmailSummary): This project summarizes large volumes of Gmail messages, integrating Gmail with OpenAI.
6. [**WordCanvas**](https://github.com/DocsaidLab/WordCanvas): This project generates text images to solve the problem of insufficient training data for OCR models.

Of course, there's more, but most are still in the planning stages, so I won't go into details now.

## Are You an Engineer?

Yes.

I enjoy using scientific knowledge to solve practical problems and find joy in doing so.

Ôºä

Years ago, those who worked with images called themselves "computer vision engineers," those who worked with text were "natural language processing engineers," and distinctions even existed for "machine learning engineers" and "deep learning engineers," with a hierarchy of disdain among these groups within certain small circles.

Regardless of the title, everyone looked down on "AI engineers":

- Hmph! Just another senseless title used by companies/positions/job seekers to sound impressive!

As time passed, we were astounded to find that text, images, and audio data from various dimensions have unified under the wave of "foundation models," becoming essential for topping leaderboards, scoring high, and publishing papers!

People realized that these engineers were all the same, just working in different dimensions doing similar things.

Soon, no one differentiated between types of engineers because academic research topics had become interdisciplinary, requiring knowledge across various fields to continue research. Thus, it became challenging to define what exactly one is.

Looking back, we see:

- Yes, that's right! AI Engineer!

## Github Organization Account

> As recommended by Github: Want to code together? Start an organization!

The purpose of creating an organization is simple; it's not really about starting a big enterprise but about finding that Github's organizational accounts offer more features than personal accounts, allowing others to join in coding and research interesting topics together, importantly, without extra cost.

With so many advantages, why not create one for fun?

Ôºä

The hardest part about this whole thing was coming up with a name.

Analyzing text is my daily job, including image text recognition, image fraud detection, topic classification, keyword extraction, and more. From my perspective, text isn't just words; it can be an image, a video, a song, a dataset, or even a person's behavior. Thus, anything analyzable or worth analyzing, in my view, can be considered text (chaotic evil?).

So ultimately, I chose a name related to this field, called **DOCSAID**.

This name combines "DOC" and "SAID," roughly meaning:

- **The moment a document is created, it has already expressed its intended content.**

So, what exactly did these documents say? Now we just need to analyze them!

Interestingly, after choosing this name, I found it also contains the letters AI, which was a delightful surprise.

## What Is This Place?

This is a website generated through automatic deployment with Github Pages.

:::info
Surprise! So if Github goes down, so does this site.

That's why we need to take good care of Github and not let it break. (What a conclusion!)
:::

I've always had a habit of blogging. I used **Dot Blog** for about two years before giving it up because it was too cumbersome.

Then I tried **Wordpress.org** for about half a year before

giving up on it too.

- **Engineers should write documentation in Markdown! Isn't Elementor laggy?**

Recently, while wandering around, I stumbled upon Meta's open-source [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/), found its features adequate, and the deployment process straightforward:

- **Writing and deploying with Markdown, +10 points**
- **Automatic deployment, +10 points**
- **Usable with React, +10 points**
- **Many reasons to add points, simply put, it's very useful.**

So, I decided it was the right choice.

Docusaurus allows me not only to write articles but also provides technical document management, which you are viewing now. It has given me something new to work on:

- Writing technical documentation.

Documenting is truly a refining activity; it helps engineers clarify their thoughts, reorganize their knowledge, and assist others in understanding their ideas quickly. The only downside is "time consumption"; spending a significant amount of time on documentation may slow down engineering progress.

However, I believe it is worth it.

If you find some content missing, it means I'm still working on it, so please be patient.

## How to Adjust the Model

This might be the topic you're most concerned about.

Based on the topic I've defined and the model I've provided, I believe it can solve most application scenarios.

I also know that some scenarios might require better model performance, so you'll need to collect your own dataset and fine-tune the model.

You might get stuck at this step, as most people do. Don't worry.

- **Scenario 1: You know the project functionality I provided meets your needs, but you don't know how to adjust it**

  In this case, you can simply send me an email with your requirements and the dataset you want to solve. I can help you fine-tune the model, so you can achieve better performance.

  No charge, but no deadlines either, and I can't guarantee execution. (This is important!)

  Although I work on open-source projects, I‚Äôm not just doing this for fun. When the time is right, the model will naturally be updated. You just need to send an email to "possibly" get better model performance. After all, it's a win-win situation, right?

- **Scenario 2: You want to develop a specific feature**

  Then email me to discuss it. If I find it interesting, I'll be happy to help you develop it, but I hope you can prepare a sizable dataset first. Even if I'm interested, I might not have the time to gather enough data, or some specific data might require special channels to obtain.

  This scenario, like the previous one, is free of charge but without deadlines, and no guarantees of execution.

  :::tip
  If the specific feature is for public model competitions, the answer is no. These competitions often have copyrights and related restrictions, and complaints might cause trouble from the organizers.
  :::

- **Scenario 3: You are looking for rapid development of a specific feature**

  When time is your primary concern, we can turn to a commissioned development cooperation model. Based on your requirements, I'll propose a reasonable quote.

  Additionally, the issue of project ownership must be discussed first. Generally, I will retain ownership of the project, and you can freely use it. I do not recommend buying out the project because it does not align with the concept of continuous improvement. With technological advancements, today's solutions may soon be replaced by updated methods. If you buy out a project, you may find that this investment loses its original value over time.

  :::tip
  You might not understand the issue of project ownership.

  Think carefully; perhaps you just want to "drink the milk" and not actually "own the cow."

  - How tiring is it to own a cow? (You have to hire engineers to maintain the project)
  - It takes up space and is hard to care for. (You need to set up training machines; renting cloud machines is expensive, and buying hosts can be prone to failures)
  - It fears both cold and heat. (Model tuning can drive you crazy)
  - It can die unexpectedly. (Not achieving expected results)
  - It‚Äôs really a loss. (Spending money to buy out the project)
    :::

  Besides, most projects' most valuable aspect is the dataset, followed by the problem-solving approach.

  Without open-sourcing private datasets, obtaining a piece of code mainly serves as a viewing purpose only.

  If, after careful consideration, you still insist on buying out the project, I won‚Äôt stop you. Go ahead.

  :::info

  - **In all forms of development projects, we will never open-source the data you provide unless we have your permission.**
  - **Under normal procedures, data will only be used to update the model.**
  - **Dataset submission: docsaidlab@gmail.com**

## Conclusion üçπ

I am an AI engineer, not an omnipotent one; I can't solve all problems.

You can tell from this site that my skill tree is somewhat skewed; I'm best at: "Given an input, requiring a specific output," and I'll try to solve it with models, just like my open-source projects. As for other areas, I'm still learning, hoping to become more comprehensive and solve more problems in the future.

Ôºä

In this era, we are fortunate to have big companies like Google, OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA, and an active open-source community driving technological development. Their contributions allow us to learn cutting-edge technologies and gain rich knowledge.

I believe every small contribution is part of our collective effort to create a better life.

If my projects can help you in any way, feel free to use them.
