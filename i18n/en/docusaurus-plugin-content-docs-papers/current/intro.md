# Introduction

## Daily Routine

Reading papers is one of my daily tasks.

Since the advent of ChatGPT, the way I read papers has become easier. Sometimes I converse with ChatGPT, and sometimes I ask ChatGPT to summarize the contents of papers for me. Here, I've documented some of the papers I've read with ChatGPT. The content "mostly generated by ChatGPT," occasionally I insert a sentence or two to supplement some thoughts.

At the same time, please understand that I'm just an ordinary engineer, not an all-knowing scholar. There may be some errors in my understanding of these papers. If you have any doubts about the content here, **please refer to the original papers**. Feel free to give me feedback so I can better understand these papers.

## Additionally

I'd like to say: there are really so many papers!

On one hand, there's a sense of perpetual helplessness at never being able to finish them all, and on the other hand, there's the excitement of discovering new technologies. It's really hard to put into words.

I'll try to document all the papers I've read here, but this process may take a long time. After all, reading papers is quick, but writing about them is another matter entirely.

If you have any papers you'd like to read or discuss with me, feel free to let me know. I'll take a look if I have the time.

If I have the time, that is.
