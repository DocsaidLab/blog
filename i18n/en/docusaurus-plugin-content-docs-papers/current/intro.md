# Introduction

## Daily Routine

Reading papers is part of my daily work.

Since the advent of ChatGPT, reading papers has become easier, but this doesn't mean we can relinquish our responsibility to think critically.

Here, I document my experiences analyzing papers with ChatGPT.

Please understand that I'm just an ordinary engineer, not an all-knowing scholar.

Therefore, my interpretations of the papers might have biases or errors. If you have any doubts about the content, **please refer to the original papers**.

Your feedback is also welcome to help me gain a deeper understanding of these studies.

We thought we could just give a paper to ChatGPT, and it would automatically write an article.

- Life isn’t that straightforward, is it?

In the end, we found that we still need to read the papers ourselves and write the first draft.

Then, when encountering difficult parts, we hand them over to ChatGPT for help. This turns out to be the fastest strategy.

## Papers

If you're looking for papers, we suggest you paste the paper title into the search bar at the top right corner. This will help you find the desired paper more quickly.

Our writing follows a fixed format:

- The title consists of the [publication month and year] + [author's name or the paper's commonly known name in the industry]
- The content starts with a casual introduction
- Then defines the problem the paper aims to solve
- Followed by an introduction to the proposed solution
- And finally, a discussion and conclusion

So, this is not exactly a translation of the paper, but more like a guided reading.

If you find **errors or broken links** during your reading, please leave a comment to inform us, and we'll fix them as soon as possible.

## One More Thing

We also want to say: there are so many papers!

On one hand, there’s the overwhelming feeling of never being able to read them all, and on the other, the excitement of discovering new technologies—it's truly a mix of emotions.

Moreover, writing a guided reading for a paper is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. The time spent writing one article could be used to read five papers.

Therefore, the writing of these articles often depends on our availability.

If you have any papers you want to read or discuss with me, feel free to let us know, and we'll take a look when we have time.

When we have time, that is.
