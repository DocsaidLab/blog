# Introduction

## Daily Routine

Reading papers is part of my daily routine.

Since the advent of ChatGPT, reading papers has become easier, but it doesn't mean we can skip thinking altogether.

Here, I've compiled some records of papers I've read along with ChatGPT.

At the same time, please understand that I'm just a regular engineer, not an all-knowing scholar.

There might be some misunderstandings in my comprehension of these papers. If you have any doubts about the content here, **please refer to the original papers**. Feel free to provide feedback as well, so I can better understand these papers.

You might think we just feed papers to ChatGPT and it churns out articles on its own.

It's not that convenient!

The truth is: when you throw the whole article at ChatGPT with confusion, you'll likely end up with more confusion.

＊

I have to read the papers myself and write the articles on my own.

When encountering difficulties in writing or understanding, then I turn to ChatGPT for assistance.

Believe me, this is the most efficient method.

## Also

I'd like to add: there are just so many papers!

It's a perpetual feeling of not being able to finish them all, yet there's also excitement in discovering new technologies. It's really hard to put into words.

And writing a paper overview takes a lot of time and effort; the time spent writing one article could be used to read five papers.

So, when it comes to writing, it mostly depends on fate~

If you have any papers you'd like to read or discuss with me, feel free to let me know. I'll check them out when I have the time.

When I have the time, that is.
