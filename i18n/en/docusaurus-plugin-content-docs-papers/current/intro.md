# Introduction

## Daily Routine

Reading papers is part of my daily routine.

Since the advent of ChatGPT, going through papers has become much easier, but that doesn't mean we can overlook the responsibility of critical thinking.

Here, I document my insights into analyzing papers with ChatGPT.

However, please understand that I'm just an ordinary engineer, not an all-knowing scholar.

Therefore, my interpretation of papers may be biased or flawed. If you have any doubts about the content, **please refer to the original paper**.

Your feedback is also welcome to help me gain a deeper understanding of these studies.

You might think I just throw the paper at ChatGPT, and it magically writes the article for me.

It's not that simple!

The reality is: when you blindly feed the entire paper to ChatGPT, it often deepens your confusion.

The most efficient way is: read the paper yourself first, draft your article, and then when encountering difficulties or parts that are hard to understand, turn to ChatGPT for assistance.

Trust me, this is the wisest strategy.

## Also

I'd like to add: there are just so many papers!

It's a perpetual feeling of not being able to finish them all, yet there's also excitement in discovering new technologies. It's really hard to put into words.

And writing a paper overview takes a lot of time and effort; the time spent writing one article could be used to read five papers.

So, when it comes to writing, it mostly depends on fate~

If you have any papers you'd like to read or discuss with me, feel free to let me know. I'll check them out when I have the time.

When I have the time, that is.
