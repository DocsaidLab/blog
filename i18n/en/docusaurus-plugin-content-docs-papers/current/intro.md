# Introduction

## Daily Routine

Reading papers is a part of my daily routine.

Since the advent of ChatGPT, reading papers has become easier, but that doesn't mean we can shirk our responsibility to think critically.

Here, I document my experiences and insights while analyzing papers with the help of ChatGPT.

Please understand that I am just an ordinary engineer, not an omniscient scholar. Therefore, my interpretations of the papers might be biased or incorrect. If you have any doubts about the content, **please refer to the original papers**.

Your feedback is also welcome to help me gain a deeper understanding of these studies.

You might think I just throw papers at ChatGPT and it automatically writes articles.

It's not that simple!

In reality, if you give the whole paper to ChatGPT when you're confused, it often only deepens your confusion. The fastest strategy is to read the paper yourself, write a draft, and then hand over the parts that are unclear or difficult to understand to ChatGPT for help.

## Papers

If you're looking for a specific paper, we recommend pasting the paper's title in the search bar at the top right corner. This will help you find the paper faster.

Our writing format is as follows:

- The title consists of: [Publication Date] + [Author's Name or Common Name of the Paper in the Industry]
- The content usually starts with a brief informal discussion
- Then defines the problem the paper aims to solve
- Next, introduces the method used to solve the problem
- Finally, discusses the results and conclusion

So, this is not a translation of the paper but more of a guided reading.

If you find any **errors or broken links** during your reading, please leave a comment to let us know, and we will fix them as soon as possible.

## i18n

English dominates the entire technology field, and various papers are published in English.

We believe that English-speaking individuals can understand the papers directly, so providing English translations in the `Papers` section seems redundant. Therefore, we will omit this part of i18n.

## And Also

We also want to say: there are so many papers!

On one hand, there's the overwhelming feeling of never being able to read them all, and on the other, there's the excitement of discovering new technologies. It's quite a complex emotion.

Moreover, writing a guided reading of a paper is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. The time it takes to write one article could be used to read five papers.

So, writing articles really depends on fate~

If there are any papers you want to see or discuss with me, feel free to let us know. We'll check them out if we have the time.

If we have the time, that is.
