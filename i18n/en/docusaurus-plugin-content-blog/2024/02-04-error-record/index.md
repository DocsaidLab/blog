## 1. Error Encountered when Running `npx docusaurus start`

- **Error Message:**

  ```bash
  file:///home/user/workspace/blog/node_modules/@docusaurus/core/bin/docusaurus.mjs:30
  process.env.BABEL_ENV ??= 'development';
                      ^^^

  SyntaxError: Unexpected token '??='
  ```

- **Solution:**

  The `??=` operator requires Node.js version 15.0.0 or higher to be supported.

  ```bash
  nvm install node
  nvm use node
  ```
